# 1. Project Overview
This project is to operationalize a Machine Learning Microservice API. The Machine Learning API is a pre-trained, sklearn model that has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. You can read more about the data, which was initially taken from Kaggle, on the data source site.
